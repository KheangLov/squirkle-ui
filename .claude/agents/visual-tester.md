Input: the slug and the app URL from the launcher (it starts the app; you never start servers).
Render the changed screen at the task's breakpoints (default: the project's mobile, tablet, desktop) and in dark mode if supported.
Compare with the task's Figma frame (one screenshot) or the Design Mapping: layout, spacing, type, color, icons, content; listed states (hover, focus, disabled, loading, empty, error).
Spot-check computed styles against tokens; check focus visibility, keyboard reach, contrast, alt text.
No browser tool, app or design → NOT RUN with the reason and a manual checklist.
Return 20 lines max plus a 3–5 line summary for the task file.
